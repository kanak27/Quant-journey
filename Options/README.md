# Options 📊

This folder covers the mathematical machinery of options — from basic payoffs through to Monte Carlo pricing of exotic contracts. Each notebook builds on the previous one, and the `.py` modules are shared across notebooks to avoid duplication.

## Notebooks

### 1. `Options basic payoffs.ipynb` — Payoff Diagrams & Covered Call
Builds intuition for vanilla options by computing and plotting profit profiles for all four basic positions, then constructs a Covered Call.

**What's covered:**
- Payoff functions for **Long Call**, **Long Put**, **Short Call**, **Short Put** (profit = payoff − premium)
- Payoff table across stock prices 1–100 (K = 50, premium = 10)
- 2×2 subplot grid of all four positions
- **Covered Call** — long stock + short call — capped upside profile

**Key insight:** The Covered Call caps profit at `premium + (K − cost_of_stock)` = 20 while retaining full downside — the classic income-vs-protection trade-off.

---

### 2. `Geometric Brownian Motion.ipynb` — Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation
Implements the GBM stochastic process from scratch. The `Geometric_Brownian_Motion.py` module extracted here is the simulation engine used by the Monte Carlo pricer.

**The model:** `S(t) = S₀ · exp((μ − 0.5σ²)t + σW(t))`

**What's covered:**
- Discrete GBM via cumulative Brownian increments
- Simulation engine: `simulate_gbm()`, `RunSimulationEngine()`, `GetTerminalPrices()`
- Path plots and terminal price histograms at 100 / 1 000 / 10 000 runs
- Convergence of terminal distribution toward log-normal

**Parameters:** S₀ = 100, μ = 5%, σ = 20%, T = 1 year, N = 252 days

---

### 3. `Black Scholes.ipynb` — Analytical Pricing from Scratch
Derives and implements the Black-Scholes closed-form formula for European calls and puts, verifies Put-Call Parity, and analyses parameter sensitivity.

**The formula:** `C = S·N(d₁) − K·e^(−rT)·N(d₂)`

**What's covered:**
- `calculateD1`, `calculateD2`, `calculateCallOptionPrice`, `calculatePutOptionPrice`
- ATM pricing: C ≈ **10.45**, P ≈ **5.57** (S=K=100, σ=20%, r=5%, T=1yr)
- **Put-Call Parity** `C − P = S − K·e^(−rT)` verified to machine precision
- 4-panel sensitivity: call price vs σ, T, S, and r

**Key findings:**
- Call price increases monotonically with σ, T, and r
- Sensitivity to S is highest near the strike — where Delta is largest

---

### 4. `Greeks.ipynb` — Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta
Implements all four first-order Greeks analytically and visualises them across a full range of stock prices. Imports `Black_Scholes.py` for d₁/d₂.

| Greek | Formula | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Delta | N(d₁) | Option price sensitivity to S |
| Gamma | N'(d₁) / (S·σ·√T) | Rate of change of Delta |
| Vega | S·N'(d₁)·√T | Sensitivity to volatility |
| Theta | see formula | Time decay (per year) |

**What's covered:**
- All four Greeks computed across S = 1–200 (K = 100), plotted as 2×2 grid
- **Theta decay curve** — theta vs time to expiry with 3-month and 1-month markers; x-axis inverted to read left = near expiry

**Key insights:**
- Delta ≈ 0.637 ATM — option price moves ~63p for every ₹1 move in underlying
- Gamma and Vega both peak at-the-money — highest sensitivity to moves and vol changes
- Theta decay is non-linear and accelerates sharply inside the final month

---

### 5. `Monte Carlo Options Pricing.ipynb` — MC Pricing & Asian Options
Connects the GBM simulation engine to the Black-Scholes framework to price options numerically, then extends to path-dependent **Asian options** — contracts BS cannot price analytically.

**What's covered:**
- `CalculatePayoff()` — vectorised max(Sₜ − K, 0) over all paths
- `CalculateMonteCarloPrice()` — simulate paths via `GBM.RunSimulationEngine`, extract terminal prices, discount mean payoff: `price = E[payoff] · e^(−rT)`
- **Convergence plot** — MC price vs number of simulations (log scale) with BS analytical price as a red dashed benchmark
- Optimised terminal-only variant (no full path needed for European options)
- **Asian Call option** — replaces terminal price with path average `E[S̄]`, making it cheaper and less volatile than a vanilla call

**Convergence results (S=K=100, σ=20%, r=5%, T=1yr):**

| Simulations | MC Price |
|---|---|
| 10 | noisy |
| 1 000 | ~10–11 |
| 10 000 | ~10.4 |
| 100 000 | ~10.45 |
| 1 000 000 | ≈ 10.45 ✓ |

**Key insight:** MC converges to the BS price (~10.45) at ~100K paths. Asian options price lower than vanilla because averaging dampens the terminal payoff — useful when hedging average-price exposures.

### 6. `Volatility smile.ipynb` — Implied Volatility Smile from a Live Option Chain
Takes a real NSE NIFTY option-chain snapshot (`option-chain-ED-NIFTY-25-Aug-2026.csv`) and turns it into a volatility smile — the first notebook driven by live market microstructure rather than textbook parameters.

**What's covered:**
- Parsing the awkward NSE CSV: a two-line header with `LTP`/`IV`/`OI` repeated on the call and put sides, thousands-commas, and `-` placeholders — cleaned into one numeric frame
- Separating `STRIKE` and the last-traded / mid prices for each side into tidy `calls` / `puts` frames
- Plotting the **exchange-reported IV** against strike (out-of-the-money each side) to draw the smile
- Inverting the Black-Scholes call price with `scipy.optimize.brentq` to recover **implied volatility from market prices**, and overlaying it against the exchange's own IV

**Key findings:**
- IV bottoms near the at-the-money strike (~8–9%) and rises into both wings — the classic equity-index skew, with the downside-put wing steeper than the upside-call wing (crash-protection premium)
- Reliable IV comes from **out-of-the-money** options; deep in-the-money strikes have near-zero vega, so their inverted IVs are numerically unstable and should be read from the other side of the book
- Small gaps between the self-computed BS IV and the exchange IV trace back to the exchange's dividend and rate assumptions, which the plain BS inversion here omits

**Note:** `T` is the true time to expiry (days remaining ÷ 365), not a round number of years — using `T = 2` would put the model price permanently above the short-dated market price and the root-finder would never converge.

---

### 7. `Black_Scholes.cpp` — C++ Implementation (OOP)
A from-scratch C++ re-implementation of the Black-Scholes pricer using object-oriented design. Produces identical results to the Python version, serving as the first step toward low-latency pricing code required at HFT firms.

**Design:**
- Free functions `Cdf(x)` (via `erfc`) and `Pdf(x)` for the standard normal CDF and PDF
- `Option` class with `const` member variables (strike, expiry, spot, vol, rate) — immutable after construction
- Private `CalculateD1()` — encapsulates the shared d₁ computation used by all methods
- Public pricing and Greeks methods

**Methods on `Option`:**

| Method | Formula | Output (S=K=100, σ=20%, r=5%, T=1yr) |
|---|---|---|
| `price()` | `S·N(d₁) − K·e^(−rT)·N(d₂)` | 10.4505836 |
| `putPrice()` | `price() − S + K·e^(−rT)` | 5.5735260 |
| `delta()` | `N(d₁)` | 0.6368307 |
| `gamma()` | `N'(d₁) / (S·σ·√T)` | 0.0187296 |
| `vega()` | `S·N'(d₁)·√T` | 37.4591246 |

**Key design choices:**
- `erfc`-based normal CDF avoids depending on `<boost>` or external libraries — compiles with standard `g++`
- All members are `const` — the object represents a fixed contract, not a mutable state
- Results match the Python implementation to 7 decimal places, cross-validating both

**Compile & run:**
```bash
cd Options
g++ -std=c++17 -o option-cpp Black_Scholes.cpp
./option-cpp
```
